"The robot has the following functions, all of which are 'off' by default." 
"When a function is 'on', it need to be involved in planning for the given task, and when it is 'off', it should not be used."
"Functions: "
"1. 'manipulation_mode_selector': this function allows the robot to add the condition node <WhetherSingleArm> to the planning of BehaviorTree, which is used to determine whether the current manipulation task should use the 'single_arm' or 'dual_arm' type of action."
"2. 'locomotion_mode_selector': this function allows the robot to add the condition node <WhetherWheelMove> to the planning of the behavior tree, which is used to determine whether the current locomotion task should use the 'wheel' or 'leg' type of action."
"3. 'detection_recovery': this allows the robot to add the condition node <IsActionSuccess>, which is used to determine whether the previous action has been successfully completed and, if not, to employ a recovery mechanism that repeat the action."
"The robot 'Motion_library' contains action nodes that the robot can use for BehaviorTree construction, as well as some condition nodes. Each node includes the following properties: 'type', 'label', 'description'."
